.PHONY: bundle download verify verify-release verify-attestation build

## bundle: download release artifacts, verify their attestations, and
## leave the extracted module tree in place. Default to running this
## whenever SPIDERMONKEY_WASM_VERSION bumps.
bundle: download verify

## download: fetch the wasm2go tarball + sha256 manifest and extract
## them into the repo root. The tarball is discarded once unpacked.
download:
	curl -fSL --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -o $(TARBALL)    $(RELEASE_URL)/$(TARBALL)
	curl -fSL --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -o $(SHA256SUMS) $(RELEASE_URL)/$(SHA256SUMS)
	tar xzf $(TARBALL)
	rm -f $(TARBALL)

## verify: byte-check each in-tree file against the sha256 manifest AND
## confirm each carries a valid GitHub artifact attestation signed by
## the upstream release.yml workflow. Either check failing aborts.
verify: verify-release verify-attestation

## verify-release: confirm every in-tree file matches the entries in
## $(SHA256SUMS). Fast sanity check; not a trust anchor on its own.
verify-release:
	@echo "==> verifying in-tree files against $(SHA256SUMS)"
	@shasum -a 256 -c $(SHA256SUMS)

## verify-attestation: confirm every in-tree artifact is a signed
## subject of the upstream SLSA build attestation. The release emits one
## attestation whose subject list covers every file in the tarball, so
## we fetch the bundle once anonymously from the public attestation
## API and then offline-verify each file via `gh attestation verify
## --bundle`. No GH access token is required.
